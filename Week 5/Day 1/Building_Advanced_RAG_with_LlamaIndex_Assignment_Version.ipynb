        "  - `OpenAIAgent` (LlamaIndex's primary agent) does not need to rely on an agent excecutor due to the fact that it is leveraging OpenAI's [functional api](https://openai.com/blog/function-calling-and-other-api-updates) which allows the agent to interface \"directly\" with the tools instead of operating through an intermediary application process.\n",
